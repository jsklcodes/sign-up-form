# Sign-up Form

This project is an implementation of the ["Sign-up Form" project from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form), focused on creating a sign-up form with basic validations.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Two-column layout with a background image and a form
- Form validation using HTML5
- Custom styling for focus and error states on form fields
- Use of CSS variables for easy customization of colors and styles

> I implemented a different version from the original design proposal but maintained the layout. I used a different theme and color palette. I also added responsiveness, even though it was not a project requirement.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Modern Normalize CSS (for consistent cross-browser reset)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
